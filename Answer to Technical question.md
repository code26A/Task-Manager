# How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 19 hours on the coding test. This included the time spent understanding the requirements, implementing the features, testing, and debugging.

# What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

In the latest version of React, the addition of **state persistence with `localStorage`** in combination with the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks was extremely helpful. This feature allows the application to retain user settings, such as task sorting and filtering preferences, across sessions.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Dashboard() {
  const [sort, setSort] = useState(() => localStorage.getItem("sortOption") || "option2");
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState(() => localStorage.getItem("filterOption") || "all");

  // Save sort option to localStorage whenever it changes
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem("sortOption", sort);
  }, [sort]);

  // Save filter option to localStorage whenever it changes
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem("filterOption", filter);
  }, [filter]);

  // More code for managing tasks...
}

# How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To track down a performance issue in production, I would follow these steps:

- Reproduce the issue in a development environment: Try to replicate the production issue locally to understand the root cause.
- Monitoring: Use performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus) to get real-time insights into system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and throughput.
   
- Logs Analysis: Review logs (application logs, server logs, etc.) to identify any unusual patterns or errors that could point to performance bottlenecks.

**Have I Ever Had to Do This?**

Yes, I've had to troubleshoot performance issues in production environments before.

# If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

If I had more time, I would consider the following improvements:

- User Authentication: Add user authentication so each user can have their own task management dashboard.
- Notification System: Implement a notification system to alert users about upcoming deadlines or task updates.
- Mobile Optimization: Improve the mobile responsiveness of the application to ensure that users can manage tasks efficiently on mobile devices.
